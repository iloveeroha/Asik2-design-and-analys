# MinHeap Implementation (Java)

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of a **Min Heap** data structure in Java, created for the "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" course.  
The project includes:
- Core MinHeap class
- Performance tracking (comparisons, swaps, array accesses)
- Unit tests with **JUnit 5**
- CLI interface for quick testing

---

## Features
- Insert elements
- Peek minimum element
- Extract minimum element
- Build heap from an array
- Decrease key operation
- Merge two heaps
- Metrics collection (comparisons, swaps, recursive calls, array accesses, memory allocations)
- Comprehensive **unit tests** covering:
    - Empty heap
    - Single element
    - Duplicates
    - Build heap from array
    - Decrease key
    - Merge heaps
    - Randomized tests

## Technologies
- **Java 17**
- **Maven** (build tool)
- **JUnit 5** (unit testing framework)
